<p class="ps2">_____________</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>A thick shroud of clouds washed over Quarrymill. It had been many moons since the small settlement had seen such precipitation, and the poorly dug ditches around the fields fought their damnedest to prevent the flooding forest from washing away all that laid outside the wooden walls. This, however, were not the worst news that had come to light in the present day.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>Indeed, Quarrymill was a small settlement with a population that couldn’t exceed the hundred heads mark at the best of times. The citizens all knew each other, they had gone through the political changes that had become common in the past cycles, and had grown accustomed to the rotation of neighbors they shared; both friendly and Garlean.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>This made it all the worst when an event such as a murder occurred within the confined space that was their home. They knew the victim, and if the perpetrator had not been an outsider that they all had caught wind of red-handed, they were left with a horrible feeling of paranoia; a traitor, a betrayer of kin amongst their midsts.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>It is for such occasions that Quarrymill would request the aid of the local powers, the Wood Wailers, or a ranger sent down by the Gridanian township; a neutral mediator to find out who could have committed such a travesty upon their own. And this time, two members of Gridania’s spearmen core had been sent down to see what all had occurred, before the rains came.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Hm. Ye, his neck has been bludgeoned.” Odoix concluded with a hushed tone. “Broke his spine, the filaments amongst the vertebrae must be smashed… some “purple-ing” on the skin too, see?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>His companion squatted down to look at the body, she had not the sharp senses of an Elezen, but had enough common sense to discern indeed the neck had no right being on this angle. “Ye, it looks broken. I don’t see any ‘filly-ments’ or purple skin though.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Bah! You’ve always been shortsighted, Obriene!” The chief barked out. “It takes delicate eyes and good rigorous humors to discern clues this fine and specular.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Chief, I will be honest. I don’t know half the words you use.” Obriene thought that neither did the chief, but she would not say that out loud.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“It is because I am a most learned scholar! You could not learn nary a word from my vocabulary working patrol shifts through the old plaza streets!” As the old inspector chief got up, he put a hand to his chest plate in proud attention. “It takes years of rigorous education to become as wiz as I!”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Whatever you say, chief.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Don’t give me that tone!” He thought for a moment. “Anyhow, this man was very clearly struck from behind, his neck bends forwards.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“I was thinking of that, ye.” Second rank-woman Obriene had dealt with murders before, mainly from brawls near the Carline Canopy, but she had not seen a man’s neck broken in such a manner. Whoever had perpetrated this crime, had to have exceptional strength.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“We should ask the locals, this fledge was one of their own.” Odoix said with a confidence in his every word.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“All right. I will ask the local guard, chief how about you-“</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“I’ll inquire in their… tavern. Yes.” The chief looked around. “Perhaps a bit of coin and a few drinks will earn me some local trust.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Y-ye, you do that, chief.” The spearwoman felt a chill go down her spine, a feeling of shame for someone who wasn’t herself. She had been warned that her lead had a tendency to conduct himself like this even during his hours of duty.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Worry not, young soldier. I shall return with results. Let us reconvene in this exact place in… let’s say three hours.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>She nodded, and before she had time to say a word, Odoix already carried himself across the street towards the local inn, his fine pencil mustache gleaming with happiness. Obriene did not expect much from the old vulture, he had served in the force longer than she had been alive; but she just hoped the man did not get himself into any trouble.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2">***</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>The rafters that hung from the wall were cold and windy, the clouds that swirled above indicating that the brewing storm was only getting worse, and the meteorological phenomena caught the eyes of many members of the local militia who stood in attention at the sight of the powerful formations of broken sky.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>It wasn’t long before Obriene had ascended the stairs to their location, none of the guards paid her any mind.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Good afternoon, gents. I’m-“ Obriene glimpsed at their intense gaze of the skies. “M-may I borrow some of your time?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>A tall Hyur man finally broke from his concentration and looked towards her. “Pardon us ma’am. It’s just… this weather.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“What’s wrong with the weather?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“It’s an omen of change, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>Obriene tried to recall if she had been told anything about the local culture having some reservations about this, but her briefing on the zone had been rather short. “How so?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“It was rain just like this one that fell right before the liberation.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>She was once again dumbstruck. “Liberation? Liberation of what?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Of my homeland, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Oh. You must be Doman.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“What?”</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span></span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>She blushed a little, blunders like this is exactly why she didn’t have non-work related conversations. “Ehm. Ala mhigan?”</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span></span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Yes.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“I see. So this must remind you of good times?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>The man stood in silence for a second. “Hardly. My brother died during a raid on a resistance camp.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>Dammit. This was getting to high levels of awkwardness, the kind of levels she could not endure, and that she did not care to indulge in. She had to end it fast. “My condolences. I- I am here for some inquiries, we were sent down from the city to check on a… a murder that has occurred, down stairs?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Ah, yes. Bergard.” He looked sad. “Yes, we were told not to touch anything related to it.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“So, you know the victim?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Aye, that I do. He came to this town the same as I, refugees from the war.” The sadness that permeated his expression splashed over into his words.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“So, I take it you are not happy with the orders?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Nay, I understand them. We were too close to him, wouldn’t get proper judgement.” He sighed, his expression went back to a serious, gruff and neutral facade. “Least we can get old Berd is some justice.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Do you have any idea what happened to him?” Obriene started taking mental notes, of all this behaviors.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“I figure he finally ticked off the wrong person on a bad day. That dullard Edard, or that fruit Atrault- always a danger that one.” He thought for a moment. “It’s the quiet ones that scare me, aye.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>Obriene sighed internally, typical. But she continued her interrogation. “Is this Edard known to dislike Bergard?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Ye, but who didn’t? Bergard didn’t get well along with a soul in town.” He laughed. “Old man would spend hours yelling at the bar keep every time he upped a drink a single gil in price. Sometimes he’d just forget what the price was, and just yell anyway.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“So… would you say he was disliked?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Ye, most of the townsfolk didn’t like Bergard. He was just not one for town life, a miner at heart that one.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Would you personally have said you liked him?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“… I.” The guard thought for a moment. “He was like a father to me. He took me and some of the boys in early, when the King still had a crown on that broken head of his.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“I assume this was long ago?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Yes, quite a while ago.” He gritted his teeth. “Shame to see him go like this.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“So… you think he might have had a disagreement with someone and that is what got him killed?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Tis just a theory.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Yes… anything else you can tell me?” Obriene took out a small tome of blank parchment. She began taking real, factual notes.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Bergard was many things, but a liar he was not.” The guard turned back to look at the clouds. “If anyone tells you otherwise, they’re full of it.”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>“Understood.” She finished noting down what she considered most important. “I didn’t catch your name?”</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>The man stared intensely at the clouds.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>‘I guess that’s as much as I get out of him.’ The spearwoman turned around towards the stairs. There were some other important spots where the guard was stationed that she could ask questions asked. And looking at the tall observation tower near the exit of town, she knew where to go next.</p>
