<p class="ps1"><a id="doc1"></a><strong><span class="s1">DRAGOON (5e Subclass)</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps2"><br /></p>
<p class="ps1">Masters of swift movement and longarm combat, these black knights have developed a tactical and precise aerial style of combat fit to pierce and destroy scaled and armored opponents of even the greatest of size.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps1"><strong><span class="s2">Dragonfire Techniques</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps1">When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn <em><span class="s3">Techniques</span></em><span class="s4"> </span>that are fueled by a special dice called <em><span class="s5">Jump Dice</span></em>.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps1"><strong><em><span class="s6">Techniques</span></em></strong>. You learn three <em><span class="s3">Techniques</span></em> of your choice. Many of them will enhance your movement or help you position yourself and your allies in combat in some way. You can only use one technique per attack.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps1">You learn two additional techniques of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new techniques, you may replace one you already know with a different one as well.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps1"><strong><em><span class="s6">Jump Dice. </span></em></strong>You have <em><span class="s5">four</span></em> jump dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all your superiority dice after you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority dice at 10th level and one more at 15th level.</p>
<p class="ps1"><br /><strong><em><span class="s6">Saving Throws</span></em></strong>. Some techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps1"><strong><span class="s7">Technique Save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps1"><strong><span class="s2">Sole Stomp</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps1">At 3<span class="s8">rd</span> level, a dragoon learns how to properly land on a target, or survive the landing after a failed dive. You take halved damage from any fall, and take no damage from falling on top of a space occupied by another creature. </p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps1">If no other spell, feature or <em><span class="s5">technique</span></em> override this effect; you are then forced 5 feet in any direction of your choosing away from that creature.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<p class="ps1">If that creature’s AC is below your <em><span class="s5">Technique Save DC</span></em>, they receive 1 + your Fighter Level <em><span class="s5">piercing</span></em> damage.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps1"><strong><span class="s2">Vorpal Thrust</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps1">At 7th level, anytime after you’ve landed from a fall or jump, you may make an attack with a weapon as a bonus action that turn.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps1"><strong><span class="s2">High Jump</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps1">At 10th level, your Jump action, or any action that uses the effect of a Jump action, also moves you like if you had taken the Dash action.</p>
<p class="ps3"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps1"><strong><span class="s2">Eye of the Dragon</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps1">At 15th level, your Jump Dice become d10s. At 18th level, they become d12s.</p>
